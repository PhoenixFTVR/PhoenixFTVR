- 👋 Hi, I’m @PhoenixFTVR
- 👀 I’m interested in a ton of things! I make art in many different ways, for example with painting, 3d modeling, sound design, coding silly little games, etc!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese! And I'm interested in learning Python as well... I love learning languages of different formats.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtual reality games! But I'm also never opposed to regular 2D videogames as well. 
- 📫 How to reach me through email: phoenix@funtrainvr.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a third degree black belt in taekwondo
